### investigation, considerations and finally the implementation

At the beginning of the development of this task I made simple scratch on paper of the tab form with all main elements like input fields, buttons and texts.
Then I took BootStapVue package for better design of this widget.
The fisrt step of development was creation of the fist tab with all elements, which was used as template for all widget tabs.
The second step was making of all functions for calculating of results and connection of variables of elements of one tab into one tab object.
The third step was creation of buttons ADD REMOVE CLONE, which allow to manage tabs independently.
The fourth step was creation of Submit button with validation function.
The fifth step was  to clean up of source code.
